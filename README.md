## Getting Started

Use the [Site Creator Tool](https://da.live/app/adobe-commerce/storefront-tools/tools/site-creator/site-creator) to quickly spin up your own copy of code and content.

Alternatively, you can follow our [Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/get-started/) for a more detailed walkthrough.

## Updating Drop-in dependencies

You may need to update one of the drop-in components, or `@adobe/magento-storefront-event-collector` or `@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk` to a new version. Besides checking the release notes for any breaking changes, ensure you also execute the `postinstall` script so that the dependenices in your `scripts/__dropins__` directory are updated to the latest build. This should be run immediately after you update the component, for example:

```bash
npm install @dropins/storefront-cart@2.0. # Updates the storefront-cart dependency in node_modules/
npm run postinstall # Copies scripts from node_modules into scripts/__dropins__
```

This is a custom script which copies files out of `node_modules` and into a local directory which EDS can serve. You must manually run `postinstall` due to a design choice in `npm` which does not execute `postinstall` after you install a _specific_ package.
